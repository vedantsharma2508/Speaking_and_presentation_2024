Identify the characteristics of effective public speakers. Public communication, unlike interpersonal communication, occurs in a somewhat formal setting and requires the communicator to be well prepared. Effective speakers understand the challenges involved in speaking before others and work in a systematic manner to create, prepare, and deliver their presentations. The public-speaking process begins when you first consider addressing a group of people. Four main stages of speech making follow: topic selection, topic development, the presentation itself, and the postpresentation analysis.



    Approach public speaking systematically, that is, select a topic, develop a topic, present a speech, and analyze its effectiveness. A thorough analysis of yourself and a thorough analysis of your audience are the essential preliminary steps in topic selection. Information about your audience should come from your personal experience with the group, from original research (for example, news releases and interviews), or both. First, you need to determine audience demographics, including such factors as age, gender, family orientation, religion, cultural background, occupation, economic status, educational level, and membership in organizations. Then you should try to predict the attitudes the listeners will have toward you and your presentation. It will help you to know whether audience members are required to attend, are homogeneous or heterogeneous in their attitudes, are favorably or unfavorably disposed toward your position, or are uninterested in your topic altogether.



3.
Explain how the nature of the occasion influences a speech. Identifying the occasion and your role in it is another essential step in the process of preparing a speech. Once you have determined the date, time limit, and location of the speech as well as the nature of the occasion and the audience, you can start thinking about a suitable topic. Choosing a topic usually involves two steps: selecting a general subject and narrowing it down to a manageable topic. You can evaluate your topic by answering these questions: Is the topic worthwhile? Is it appropriate for the intended audience? Is it interesting? Is sufficient research material available? Will there be enough time to cover the topic adequately?



4.
Formulate clear and precise purpose statements for yourself and behavioral objectives for your audience. After you have chosen your topic, you need to reexamine your purpose for speaking. Most speakers have one of two general objectives when they prepare to deliver a speech: to inform listeners (to share new information or insights) or to persuade listeners (to convince the audience to believe or do something). To ensure that your purpose is clear, you should formulate a purpose statement-a summary of what you want to accomplish, expressed as an infinitive phrase. For example, you may want to inform your audience about something, to describe something, or to explain how something is done. You can also list behavioral objectives-abilities you want the audience to have internalized after listening to your presentation. -->





    <!-- Identify main and subordinate ideas. Organization is one of the main challenges facing the speech maker. Part of the organization challenge is to distinguish between main and subordinate ideas. Main ideas are the primary points of a speech. Subordinate ideas amplify the main ideas.



2.
Create a complete sentence outline. One of the best ways to organize your speech is to build its framework and prepare a complete sentence outline using the introduction-body-conclusion format. Since the body of the speech is the main part of your presentation, it should be prepared first.



3.
Identify five methods of ordering ideas. There are five generally accepted ways based on linear logic to order the ideas in a speech:
(1) chronological order, (2) spatial order, (3) cause-and-effect order,
(4) problem-and-solution order, and (5) topical order. Speakers from a number of cultural groups prefer to use configural logic to structure their ideas.



4.
Use internal summaries and transitions effectively. When you use linear logic, the body of your presentation must also have internal summaries and transitions to help listeners recall the content. (Professional speakers today must be prepared to give very short synopses-sound bites-to the media if they want to appear on the air.)



5.
Develop an effective introduction and conclusion. After the body of the speech has been completed, you are ready to prepare the introduction and conclusion. The introduction should gain the attention of the audience members, make them want to listen to your speech, and provide them with an overview of the subject to be discussed. Devices used to enhance introductions include humor, illustrations, questions, surprising statements, and statistics. The purpose of the conclusion is to summarize the material covered, heighten the impact of the presentation, and enable the audience to leave the occasion with your ideas freshly impressed on their minds. Devices used to increase the effectiveness of conclusions include surprising statements, rhetorical questions, quotations, and humor.



6.
Use a tryout to refine a speech. When you have completed the outline for the entire speech, you should become your own audience: Try out the speech and analyze the results. Be sure to take into account any cultural barriers that might affect your presentation to be sure that your presentation is clear to all members of your audience. -->

<!-- Assess your level of speech anxiety. Anxiety or fear affects all speech makers. One of the best ways to cope with speech fright is to design and rehearse your presentation carefully. In addition, you should learn to recognize the causes of fear, as well as the physical and mental sensations that accompany it, so that you can learn to control your reactions with appropriate behavior modification techniques.



2.
Use deep-muscle relaxation, thought stopping, visualization, and other techniques to reduce speech anxiety. Among the techniques you can use to reduce speech anxiety are thought stopping and visualization. Both of these techniques help to eliminate the thoughts and symptoms associated with fear; the first by stopping the fear inducing process, the second by boosting confidence.



3.
Discuss four types of delivery: manuscript, memorized, impromptu, and extemporaneous. There are four general options for delivery: (1) A manuscript speech is written out word for word and then read aloud.
(2) A memorized speech is a manuscript speech committed to memory. (3) An impromptu speech is delivered on the spur of the moment. (4) An extemporaneous speech is researched, outlined, and delivered after careful rehearsal.



4.
Identify how the speaker can use visual and vocal cues to advantage. In delivering the speech, you have three basic kinds of tools at your disposal: verbal, visual, and vocal. Far too often, the verbal component is overemphasized while the nonverbal aspects are underemphasized. Effective speech making requires that you pay attention to the visual aspects of your delivery, such as your clothing, posture, gestures, movements, and use of eye contact, and that your vocal cues reinforce-rather than sabotage-the content.



5.
Analyze a speech maker's performance (including your own) in terms of content, organization, language, and delivery. Careful rehearsal of your presentation can help you develop the confidence and competence required to deliver an outstanding speech. To ensure continued improvement, you should conduct postpresentation analyses, which will enable you to profit from each speaking experience. -->





<!-- Define informative speaking.
The goal of the informative speaker is to offer audience members more information than they presently have about a topic. The informative speaker aims to update and add knowledge, refine understanding, or provide background.

Distinguish between three types of informative discourse.
There are three kinds of informative speaking with which you need to be familiar:

Messages of explanation: Speeches of demonstration that explain the "what" or "how-to" of a subject.
Messages of description: Speeches that describe what a person, object, or event is like.
Messages of definition: Speeches that define what something is.
Explain how to create "information hunger" and increase listeners' comprehension.
A primary goal of the informative speech is to increase each listener's "need to know" and "hunger" to receive a message. To do this, speakers need to analyze the audience and use appropriate attention-getting devices to generate interest in their topics. At the same time, speakers must avoid overloading or underloading receivers with information.

Develop and present an informative speech.
Being able to design and deliver an effective informative speech has important implications for both your career and life. An effective informative speech makes listeners want to learn more about the topic, communicates information clearly, involves audience members, and delivers information in a way that makes the speech memorable. -->




<!-- Define persuasive speaking.
Persuasive speaking is the means a speaker uses to modify the thoughts, feelings, or actions of receivers so that they change attitudes or behavior the speaker does not approve of and instead adopt attitudes and behaviors compatible with the speaker's interests and worldview. The proposition of the speech indicates the kind of change the persuasive speaker would like to create in receivers.

Define and distinguish between attitudes and beliefs.
To influence receivers, speakers need to address their attitudes and beliefs. Attitudes are the mental sets or predispositions receivers bring to a speech. Beliefs are the building blocks of attitudes. A receiver's belief system is comprised of everything the receiver believes to be true. Whereas attitudes are measured on a favorable-unfavorable scale, beliefs are measured on a probable-improbable scale. The more central a belief, the harder it is to change.

Distinguish between logical and fallacious reasoning.
Speakers who provide logical reasons to support their propositions improve their chances of realizing their speech-making goals. By using deductive and inductive reasoning, reasoning from causes and effects, and reasoning from analogy, speakers can build their case and earn receiver support. Ethical speakers avoid fallacious reasoning, such as argument ad hominem, red herring, false division, false cause, bandwagon appeal, and appeal to authority.

Explain the concept of credibility.
A speaker's success as a persuader is partly determined by their credibility—how the audience perceives them. To be found credible, receivers must believe the speaker is of good character, knowledgeable, and personable. The assessment of credibility can change during or as a result of a speech.

Develop and present a persuasive speech.
A persuader must build an effective case with well-supported reasons and appeals for accepting their proposition. The audience must be engaged in the speech, sense the speaker's conviction, and be reminded at the conclusion of what they need to believe or do. -->




<!-- Learning Objectives
Identify and use research resources
Use various online and offline tools for gathering effective research materials, including books, journals, newspapers, and internet sources like emails, listservs, and websites.

Conduct surveys and interviews
Collect data through informal surveys or personal interviews based on your observations and experiences.

Understand supporting materials
Utilize definitions, statistics, examples, illustrations, and testimonials to make your speech more compelling.

Employ techniques for impact
Enhance your speech by using comparison, contrast, repetition, and restatement for clarity and emphasis.

Incorporate visual and audio aids
Use objects, models, graphs, photos, and computer-generated visuals to reinforce and dramatize your concepts effectively.

Preview
Persuasion, as Chapter 14 illustrates, hinges on one's perception of reasoning, evidence, logic, and credibility. An easy mistake for speakers to make is to assume that what is reasonable and logical to them is also reasonable and logical to everyone else. It just isn't so, as Myron W. Lustig and Jolene Koester illustrate in this excerpt from their book, Intercultural Competence. With fascinating intercultural examples, they describe particular approaches to preferred choices of reason, logic, and evidence across cultures. What is often called common sense might better be called culture sense. You will find this information applicable as you strive to adapt to the audience, choose evidence, use reasoning, and establish your credibility in a way that is pertinent to the cultural context you are speaking in.
